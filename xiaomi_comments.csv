1,I did,3h
2,I received it two or three days ago. I do not really see any big improvement...I'd actually say I prefer the older Android 10 based version when it comes down to dealing with notifications.,2h
3,They actually said that thee is no difference between MIUI 12 and MIUI 12.5 only if you know where to go,54m

9,"I'm pretty satisfied with it, though I got a notification to check what's new but it didn't lead anywhere so dunno what's totally new.",50m
10,"i got it on my mi 9 but its weirdly buggy. apps deleted will leave a blank space in the app drawer, the phone wants to restore miui stuff after a factory reset but i cant see what it tries to load and the download isnt progressing, the play store cant update some apps for some reason, and the system apps that xiaomi claimed are now removable will stay in the app drawer greyed out (thats not a bug thats just weird). performance and responsiveness is def improved tho",46m
11,How!? On redmi note 9 miui 12.0.1.0 grobal,2h
12,I've got 12.5.1,2h

19,Honest question. Why do people like you highjack posts to say this?What does your comment have anything to do with this thread?,32m
0,Reddit app is shit,6h
1,use infinity,9h
2,Reddit app is kind of laggy sometimes no matter which brand of phone I use. It's more of a Reddit problem than the phone itself. Sometimes I just clear cache then scroll really fast back and forth without reading to wait for them to load.,6h
3,"I agree. Sometimes apps do really lag, I just wipe it off then reinstall it.",4h
4,Can you perhaps record it and upload it? Is it possible for you to record it?,6h
5,"I guess it's the app and not your phone, the reddit app is not very optimized and sometimes lags, or freezes, or crashes, etc...",5h
6,Try restarting your phone. Or you can do a full reset that might fix it.,9h
7,"Do a restart.If not fixed after a while do a factory resetIf all failed and you don't care about warranty, throw pixel experience on it",8h
8,"Custom roms dont really void warranty , if you want to send it back , just flash stock rom and thats about it",8h
9,"Its really laggy on reddit compared to other apps, like chrome is laggy compared to samsung internet.",7h
10,use brave,5h
11,"It is better to show ""lag"" to help us to help? I am on laptop and sometimes post cards(I use modern reddit and sometimes with card or sometimes with line mod) vibrate but its really rare so just I ignore it. And I have seen this problem with my friends phones and laptops, we couldn't find any solution.",8h
12,"Damn, sad bruh. Works sickly good for me. A restart should help. If not a reset should be you way to go, take a backup and go for it",6h
13,"120hz mode is a curse in RN10P. lags in apps, flickering in youtube full screen and floating windows, etc.",4h
14,"I use Boost for Reddit in my Redmi Note 10 Pro (even in my previous phone). It's really lightweight, runs smooth in my 2015 samsung",3h
15,Use Boost for Reddit,2h
16,"use ""boost for reddit"" as an alternative app for reddit. i bet you'll uninstall the original app at an instant",1h

0,"It's an app that isn't available in whatever region you're in. I have it also on the Mi Note 3 Global ROM. There are a few other apps like that that are installed as part of the ROM but only show if you are set to a particular region. There are extra apps for India for example than are visible if your region is set to a European one.I also recently received this update, it's nothing to be concerned about. Either update it or ignore it if it happens again. It is just not available in your (or my) region.",3h
1,"A good question, I would also like to know what it is all about....",4h
2,"Xiaomi has some apps geared towards their biggest audiences, usually apps baked into the system specifically for India or China, but since it isn't available in your region, it gets hidden.",3h
3,Bloatware. Removed it a while ago. Didn't experience any problem.,2h
0,Put lube on the hinge.,8h
1,I will try this one though I'm a little nervous on where to put the lube. Thank you so much!,8h
2,I bought this earphones almost a year ago. This is my first ever and treasured bluetooth earphones. I'm worried that letting this be like that might affect it negatively. I am planning to put some oil in it but I am nervous for I might make it worse. Is there anything that I can do to solve this?,8h
3,"Silicone spray, probably best to wipe on with a qtip",2h
0,I updated and i have the same issue. Maybe there is a fix?,27m
1,"I tried resetting my wifi, mobile network and bluetooth settings.. will keep you posted tomorrow if theres a change",13m
0,"Are they set to follow the system theme? Like in the gmail settings?I've got opposite issues. All apps like FB, Reddit, Insta all go into dark mode when miui dark mode is on, even when set not to!Miui.... Love it but it's always been a buggy mess. Perhaps its just one of those things",4h
1,"That's the thing, there's no in-app settings for the theme.",4h
0,I have a Redmi Note 9 Pro and my niece had the Redmi Note 10 Pro. The difference was pretty clear in camera.Considering the camera quality gap of the Note and Note Pro even in the same generation. There is definitely a very noticeable difference of a Note 7 and a Note 10 Pro in photo quality,6h
1,Yea,7h
2,"i have a redmi note 5 pro ,wil i see a bigger difference?",6h
3,Here's a photo sample of mine taken on my RN10 pro https://i.imgur.com/s5kjFvY.jpg,2h
0,Yes - if you have the right roms kernel and recovery that support it,1h
1,no im asking just by flashing two rom in two partitions and choosing what to boot using fastboot,1h
2,"You can't, it just doesn't work that way",13m
0,It's possible to downgrade but I think you need to use adb and fastboot rather than with TWRP.,4h
1,"you can flash miui 10 based rom in twrp, but you can't downgrade the oem rom with twrp, use fastboot",2h
0,"PS. Problem solved! Changed the stupidest ever new swipe-down-then-right notification setting to classic (found it was possible and screeched from joy!) and re-enabled sporify's notification rights, the operating window is now back. Hope this helps someone else 👌",5h

1,why,2h
2,"I debloated MIUI, removed some useless android system apps and can use miui for 2 days. I tried unlocking the bootloader for me but i failed 3 times. So decided to just debloat it anyways. It works like a god now. i also didnt  experience any bugs.",1h
3,"I have a Redmi Note 8T and I installed Pixel Experience on it, and it's pretty good! I actually would have stayed with MIUI if they would have released a normal fix update rather just security patches after 6 months of waiting, but yeah if you like stock android, then PE is the way to go.",21m
0,You can unlock bootloader and boot into recovery with fastboot commands. Mi a2 uses a/b partition so when you flash rom it gets flashed to inactive slot. So you need to switch slots before booting.,2h
0,What do you mean compatible? Compatible with what?,6h
1,"With iphone , all the features is fully functional  ?",6h
0,"How did you turn it off? Did you turn on and off the steady video mode? That (I think) applies extra, digital stabilization (eis is called, I think). I think you can't turn off ois, like in dslr lens. But anyways, can you check it with a display model in a shop?🤷",22m
1,Yeah that was in settings. Does it really only affect eis? Why did it go like this? And what about the shop? It's an authentic mi 11 ultra.,19m
0,I have a mi 10 (xiaomi.eu + root) and it ~isn't buggy.😅 But I've done ~nothing related with finance and some apps may not like unlocked bootloader or root (though many times you can hide it).Edit: If you're ever willing to spend ~1-2days to learn anything you don't know and tinker with the phone to flash a custom rom (and maybe root etc.) here is a guide I compiled:https://xiaomi.eu/community/threads/the-ultimate-guide-to-unlock-bootloader-use-twrp-flash-beta-from-stock-rom-setup-and-hide-magisk-edxposed-for-mi-10-umi-use-lp-plus-extra-tips.59306/(~Don't skip any term you don't know otherwise you may end up with errors and bootloops...),36m
0,"You have to enable Camera2Api which can be done by unlocking bootloader, gaining root access & then changes / adding few lines in build.prop I think.",13h
1,Earlier I used it on a Redmi Note 7 and it worked without doing any of this? Will they be possible for my RN 5 Pro too? Or will I have to root it?,13h
2,Put LineageOS 18.1 on it. It's smooth as hell and you'll be able to try multiple gcams. I'm using a very old gcam from December 2018 because it gives the most awesome pictures. It doesn't have night mode though.,9h
3,I would but then I won't be able to use most of the payment apps.,9h
0,Try to change your theme to stock,48m
0,Maybe try flashing the fastboot rom with mi flash?,1h
1,"I'm not an expert, but maybe it could be a hardware problem if not software. Maybe you should ask it in a Telegram group related to your device. This is the best i can do.",13m

0,"Yes, I got one mi 360 and it works 24/7 without cloud space. It is showing 5 last days recorded and 7 last days motion events on the app. I have an SD card but I'm not sure how much it can store, if you need unlimited then only in cloud.",1h
1,Mainly I'm interested in a cloud solution so if someone breaks in and they don't spot the camera in the first 20 sec(or a similar period depending on how fast the video is uploaded to the cloud) I will be able to see the footage with the burglar directly from the cloud.Mainly I'm interested in a cloud solution so if someone breaks in and they don't spot the camera in the first 20 sec(or a similar period depending on how fast the video is uploaded to the cloud)  hopefully I will be able to see the footage with the burglar directly from the cloud.,1h

Either way, not your problem and hope you get sorted with them.",1d
1,I noticed some Ali orders seems to be shipped by cargo ship. That takes months.,1d

3,"Asked him, all he said is that he will send the worry free standard in case if there’s logistic problem. What does he mean by that?",1d
4,Is this an American thing? I'm in Canada I get everything in 2 weeks. And we have a trade block with China right now.,22h

6,"I ordered  a poco F3 Apr 1 and arrived May 5. They do get stuck in tracking. Just wait. Use 17track for tracking, sometimes there is more info on that.",1d
7,I wouldn't worry. I use 17 Track for better tracking with more detail. Eventually the packages do arrive. They usually can take between 1-2 months as standard.It's also my practice to only buy items from the official stores on Ali Express as it just feels safer that way.,1d

4,Xiaomi is a powerful company miui is designed with so much bugs that what you are seeing is not the actual position of the setting. What you see is only what you have selected it to be.

9,I will try to do a factory reset,1d

4,I used eu rom on my k20 pro. Worked fine . Only problem I had was with RAM management as my game loaded from beginning. Currently using the Corvus Rom.,1d

9,"My Mi 9t pro, which is the same as the Redmi K20 pro only for Europe, runs OK after the MIUI 12.5.1 / Android 11 update.So I guess that in your case, a factory reset would clear up things a bit!BTW, neither MIUI 12 nor 12.5 did bring me any features I wanted or even liked particularly much. I will strongly take other brands into account the next time. My emphasis is: Do I get a Factory-installed launcher that can be switched to non-app drawer layout? And what is the software support duration in terms of new Adroid releases and security updates.Xiaomi had a good reputation on the software and update side *before* they expanded the market they officially deliver to. I find the security updates too rarely (now my phone is old, but it was on ""monthly fix"" only for a short time after I got it). The innovations in MIUI mostly not relevant to me or outright annoying (Bubbles, floating chat window crap, new control center that always opens just the view you do not want in that moment....). And on top of it all, the distribution of major updates once they are available is draagged out sooooo long. Even with manual checking for updates you don't get the update. I have never received an update early for checking the ""I want to receive updates earlier"" checkbox and so on... Yes, I'm really into receiving update (ex Google Nexus user...).",1d
10,"I won't be factory resetting my phone over this issue since I cannot back up the data completely, there's always a chance I may lose some important things.I like MIUI as well, in fact I have been using it since more than 5 years and this is my 3rd Xiaomi device but I have been now giving thoughts on switching to pixel. I don't care much about getting new features right away. MIUI has been feature packed since beginning and I like that. Security patches are important though and time taken between each security patch is more.Pixel has evolved a fair bit as well, it has added features over stock android so it should be good.The ad situation is pretty bad in Indian markets on Xiaomi dev, I personally haven't recieved any ads on K20 pro, I paid attention while setting up the phone but mid range gets a lot of bloat and ad ware. On K20 I just had to turn off annoying notifications.I never used new control center, I switched to old one in settings, glad there was an option. Seemed unnecessary to me.My K20 pro should easily go more 1.5 years or 2. Been using since last 2 years then I can think of switching to Pixel.",1d

0,I would suggest going for the Redmi note 10 Pro.+ It has a great screen+ It has great cameras+ It has a large Battery+ It has dual speakers+ it has expandable storage that is not hybrid+ it has a headphone jack- It has an ok chipset- No wireless charging if you care about that- No 5g,1d

4,Same. Just battery life is okay,1d
5,Mi 10T is also a great choice.,1d
6,Poco F3,1d
7,AMOLED 5G A bit faster CPU (doesn't make a difference unless you're doing some heavy gaming)No headphone jack Weaker battery compared to X3 Pro by 660mAh,1d
8,"Base it on the processor, try and get Snapdragon 8 series and you'll be set. Poco f2 pro can be had for quite cheap at times. I just bought a Poco m3 pro for my mum, that was about £200 and that's good for her tbh. Unfortunately it has a mediatek chip but at least its a much newer one. I came from Samsung to Xiaomi two years ago with my mi mix 3 and I love it. MIUI has matured a lot and has many similar features that Samsung offers software wise. Samsung offers more on their flagships though I would say. But then the price is almost twice as much.",1d
9,Poco F3,1d
10,The Poco f3. Mi 9T Pro,1d
11,"I'd recommend the Mi 10i 5g if it's available in your country. It has good performance with the 750G chip, and also a great build which cannot be said about the Poco X3. Also it has a 108mp Samsung sensor which produces amazing results (the Poco X3 has ok cameras but they are nowhere comparable to the MI 10i). The Poco X3 also lacks behind the Mi 10i in terms of performance. Also the display is much better on the Mi 10i.",1d
12,"Poco X3 Pro, Poco F3, or Mi 11 Lite 5G, whichever's cheaper.You can't go wrong either way. The only caveat is MIUI so far.",1d
13,You should go for realme x7 max it's 27000 rupess in India which is around 360 USD . And the price to performance ratio is insane. You get amoled display with 120 hz refresh rate. Dimensity 1200 which is equivalent to Snapdragon 865 but remember you will not get good custom rom support on this processor. 4500 mah battery with 50w wired charging and decent camera  that you can expect from a mid range phone. But overall in the market this is the best a phone can offer right now in my opinion for a price of 360 USD,1d
14,Maybe you could get a Budget little higher + few bucks.  U could try Poco F2 Pro overall its great phone. Miui 12.5.1 fiexd some issues with ram management so its  its nice but  could be better. Screen is amazing for this price. Watchin movies is something i love to do on my free time. HDR10 + AMOLED is crazy combination.Device works great in new games and apps. If u got any questions just ask.Im editong cuz i couldn't stop myself.SOT while watching movies is around 8hours Maybe more.if u like to watch at night..Using wifi and stuff at daylight  its ~6-7hours maybe its my problem cuz Bluetooth gps and all things are turned on 24/7LTE sucks like lte does hehe 4-5hours maybe,1d

Tried X3 Pro - trash Ultrawide cam (night shots: forget about it; Steadyshot: also trash) Xiaomi share same 8MP UWA with most of its midrangers and probably the ones that were always being suggested.X3 NFC has the most balanced camera with regards to main cam + UWA. Video-wise the UWA can do steadyshot and it's really good adaptive EIS.I've never got anything that I liked with only one phone especially when I have little budget for a phone but no one's actually limiting anyone to only one device,  I have two. Redmi 9T for cellular data, SMS, banking apps. X3 NFC for gaming, camera, video, and media playback.",1d

Poco has their own launcher.I do not like this launcher, but I also don't like move lawn chair or any of the other options currently on the play store. I want to use what I have used for the past 2 years ""MIUI System launcher"" I cannot use this because Xiaomi wants us to use the POCO launcher or another launcher.

If a waiting time is shown then wait for that period of time also don't turn off developer options in that time period leave everything as it is. Sometimes the security application turns it off so don't open it.

Notable issues with gestures on third party launchers include, but not limited to.• Close all/Clear app button not appearing(scroll all the way to verify it's not there) • Not being able to tap icons for a short time after returning to the home screen • Animations not being fluid • Home screen icons flashing • Home screen redraws.Please understand, there is absolutely NOTHING WE, NOR ANY OTHER 3RD PARTY LAUNCHER, CAN DO TO FIX OR CHANGE THIS IN ANY WAY!

7,"This is hopelessly outdated, though.Google even introduced a new API in AOSP Launcher3 that Nova Launcher uses when available. Gesture Navigation with Novs Launcher works great, actually better than ever, on current Pixel phones with Android 11, or Samsung phones with Android 11, or most other phones with Android 11 - just not Xiaomi phones with Android 11.Xiaomi failed to update their launchers (MIUI and Poco alike) to facilitate this. They could easily do so (just re-base them on a new Launcher3 codebase or backport the necessary code). Instead of doing this, Xiaomi simply disabled the feature entirely.",2d
8,"AFAIK, it's an Android 11 thing",3d
9,"Not really, it's a Xiaomi thing. This works fine on Pixel phones, or Samsung phones or most OEM's Android phones with Android 11, really. Better than in previous versions, actually.Before Android 11, Xiaomi used a long deprecated, ugly, fallback to allow gesture navigation with 3rd party launchers, Google communicated its removal well in advance. Yet when it happened it took Xiaomi by so much surprise that it took them several updates to just disable the ability to even use gesture navigation with 3rd gesture navigation (which, before the update, simply left users stranded with no functional navigation at all).Task-switching and gestures are part of the stock Launcher in current Android versions. It can and it should, easily facilitate the use of 3rd party launchers - Google even introduced a new API for 3rd party launchers to make the task switching transition smoother in Android 11 - it works great on pretty much every phone where the stock launcher is based on a current Launcher3 core. Just not on MIUI.Xiaomi is the odd one out here. They didn't update their launchers (MIUI or Poco Launcher) and the didn't and still don't give a crap about third party launchers.This isn't difficult to implement, this is a well documented AOSP Android feature they could and should implement in MIUI. They chose not to.",2d

11,This update is gorbage,2d

15,Its not working with my poco launcher also.,2d
16,It won't work. Gestures will only function with the manufacturers launchers. They are tying this functionality with their launchers after android 10.

3,"Mi A3 maybe but it's kinda old so it wouldn't be worth it. Sadly for you, Xiaomi doesn't build any small phones right now afaik so you might look elsewhere. You aren't even used to miui but to stock android. Maybe a pixel 4a / 5 would fit you're needs",1d

The inconsistency of the sensor is irritating at times but it is not unbearable. I don't have any problems with the display, it is very good. Like I said since I use earphones usually, the ear piece is not an issue for me. UI is not that bad once you get rid of the bloatware.For the specs that are offered at this price you will have to compromise on something, because this is a budget smartphone and not a flagship.

0,The issue is miui ram management not the amount of ram you have. Miui kills apps in the background regardless of the available free ram.. You can have a 12gn phone and you'll still have to wait for apps to load because they were killed by miui..,3d
1,Can ram management fixed from updates? If xiaomi decides to do it?,3d
2,Miui kills apps in the background regardless of the available free ram.not really. the mi11 series and f3 has very good memory management.,3d
3,Will it kill the same number of apps regardless of the ram being 6GB or 8GB? Or will it allow a few more on 8GB compared to a 6GB?,3d
4,This explains so much!,2d
5,Read dontkillmyapp.com There are ways to prevent that,3d
6,"problem with some apps is that they ""die"" after you switch to another app and when you get back to them they load all over again, at least some shit apps do that sometimes to me",3d
7,That is annoying,3d
8,"Yeah that's a problem with RAM management. Unfortunately basically every vendor ignores RAM usage and just use as much as they want, leaving the system starved of RAM",3d
9,"Not shit apps, dont blame the apps. Reddit, firefox, fb app and many other normal good apps just reload for no reason, sometimes after few minutes. It's the MIUI at fault here, not the apps. It doesnt happen on custom roms.",3d

11,Thanks,3d
12,25% more,3d
13,"I think the OS might use an equal amount of ram in both cases. Let's say this is 3GB. So 3GB would be available on the 6GB model and 5 on the 8GB one. So the 8GB variant should theoretically be able to run 66% more apps. Unless the OS uses more ram on a variant with higher ram. Also, each app might use more ram for a model with higher ram (I'm not sure if this is the case).",3d
14,I have k20 pro/Mi9T pro 6gb when gaming usually I have 4-5 apps in background like discord whatsapp etc.,3d
15,"Thank you so much. Can I ask you something? If you were to open a sixth app, would that kick out one of the apps out of memory?",3d
16,"Speqking from my experience,It depends on the android skin itself. In this case, MIUI. On MIUI, if you leave one app running at the background (reddit for example) for a period of time, it will be killed from running. When u launch the app, it will reload from the start.Unlike most aosp custom recovery, you will be able to leave 4-7 running app at the background and they wont be killed by the system.",3d

I have not tested benchmarks or fps in games. Use the Xiaomi bloatware remover tool if you even want to use your phone. Get rid of Google and Mi bloatware , it will make a ton of difference. Change region to South Korea if updates didnt arrive, latest is 12.5.4 which comes with a weird bug  that the audio slows down if you reboot or insert headphones. It solution is to just go to settings > sound and vibration > sound effects . Just go there and audio will gain the loudness but you will have to do this for the speakers again if you remove the headphones. Stay with 12.5.3 if you want to dodge this audio bug.

Otherwise I see no benefit for doing this.The battery life of my Mi9T is still astonishing, after 20 months. Max 5 crashes in this time, with constant usage. Speed like the first day.I still don't get why people but other phones or put on a custom ROM.I once put a custom ROM on a Samsung.

The wrongly recommended workaround is to disable MIUI Optimizations. This will break so much stuff, some permanently until a factory reset, on MIUI 12 that it should never, ever be touched by the user and the feature has been removed from current versions of MIUI entirely.The correct, and not too difficult, way is to simply sideload via ADB which is still possible, see Option C here:https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanced/wiki/installation/#wiki_option_c.3AThere is no workaround for the Nova Launcher issue besides using button navigation. Xiaomi failed to implement API changes in their stock launcher(s) to allow full and unrestricted use of 3rd party Launchers. This wasn't malevolence, just pure and simple incompetence and ignorance.Until Xiaomi rebases their launchers on a newer Launcher3 core, 3rd party launchers will remain broken. MIUI 12.5 won't fix this. MIUI 13 likely won't fix this since launcher updates aren't really tied to MIUI updates, so don't hold your breath for this to ever work on a stock ROM again.Xiaomi could push out a launcher update tomorrow to fix the issue, but so far they have chosen not to bother.The only real way out here would be a custom ROM.",4d

14,"Blame Google for making changes in A11 that no one wanted, or asked for.Before Android 11 Xiaomi used a long deprecated, ugly, fallback to allow gesture navigation with 3rd party launchers, Google communicated its removal well in advance. Yet when it happened it took Xiaomi by so much surprise that it took them several updates to just disable the ability to even use gesture navigation with 3rd gesture navigation (which, before the update, simply left users stranded with no functional navigation at all).Now you might be wondering: Is this API exclusive to Google Pixel phones? The answer is no, it isn’t. The API is part of Launcher3/QuickStep and can be found in AOSP, meaning it’s open to any OEM launcher app. While the API was committed to Launcher3 internally on July 21, 2020, it seems it was merged into the AOSP master branch with the Android R QPR1 release in December.Task-switching and gestures are part of the stock Launcher in current Android versions. It can, it should, easily facilitate the use of 3rd party launchers - in fact, it does on most Android devices: it works better than ever on Google Pixel devices, it works great on Samsung phones, it works great on pretty much every phone where the stock launcher is based on a current Launcher3 core. Just not on MIUI.Xiaomi is the odd one out here. They didn't update their launchers (MIUI or Poco Launcher) and the didn't and still don't give a crap about third party launchers.This isn't difficult to implement, this is a well documented AOSP Android feature they could and should implement in MIUI. They chose not to.So, could you explain to me again why exactly this is Google's fault and not Xiaomi's?The YouTube Vanced issue is another MIUI-exclusive feature. MIUI 12 actively prevents sideloading of split-apks (and only split apks, classic ones still sideload fine) for dog knows what fucking reason. The Xioami.EU mod removed this ""feature"" in their builds, but all official ROMs are stuck with it.The only sensible way is to sideload via ADB, which is still possible for now.Official instructions here (use Option C): https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanced/wiki/installation/#wiki_option_c.3AThe alternative of disabling MIUI Optimizations not only breaks and ungodly amount of shit in MIUI, often irreversible so (only a factory reset will fix it), the feature has also been removed in most current stock ROMs for that very reason.And, yes, of course Youtube Vanced work just fine on Android 11, the github issue you linked is completely unrelated to OPs problem. This is, again, a MIUi 12 problem. Another well-known Xiaomi-exclusive bug, or to quote the official Vanced wiki:(aka the ""haha MIUI is such a garbage ROM you have to use a special snowflake installation"" method)",4d

1,Did they even announce mi pad 5 in general?,1d
2,I remember reading about an official statement saying they were back in that market this year but no glossy announcement.

I can't find the unofficial statement about the leadership deciding against the production of the 8 inch version though...,1d
0,You need to unlock the bootloader before changing ROM and that will reset your device and delete all data.,3d
0,"Wow, it seems that your system is draining your battery. I compared your results with my Redmi Note 9 (not Pro, just normal version), and there's a huge difference on the System Android battery usage.If you updated your phone recently I recommend you to wait for the next update, maybe it will solve that issue. If not, you should try to factory reset your device.",3d

1,"I did exactly that yesterday but not after already factory resetting my phone. Since its a stock app and that too messaging I could not remove it entirely via the adb without running the risk of breaking something so I just Uninstalled the updates and continued using Textra as my main SMS app. Also I turned off MIUI optimisation from Developer options and that opened up stock android options for individual apps. So I restricted background activity for Messages as well. Now its not consuming any juice in the background and for the fear of it getting back to its ways again, I am also not updating it further from Playstore. Thanks for confirming that it was a Messages problem not MIUI.",2d

4,"Not very helpful. And I have not opted for a BETA version as you are implying. It was an automatic system update OTA. I read Stable Beta just means that the stable version is released gradually and is first available to certain devices and then after some days to all if everything goes well. That is not ""opting for BETA"", in fact, in the Feedback app there is an option to sign up for actual BETA testing, shall I choose to.And given the device has just been launched on 7th July in India, and I have been one of the earliest buyers having activated it on 8th, it would make sense that I received the Stable BETA which is now rolling out to all devices as of yesterday.Again, not very helpful. I was looking for an answer specifically about the affects de-bloating might have on system performance, or certain MIUI options that I don't know of that could help me preferably from someone who owns the said device or is in general facing such issues themselves.But thanks anyway for your reply.",4d

0,"Mi Max 2 has reached its EOL with official ROM, so even if you flash the Global ROM, you'll only have MIUI 11. So your best option is to unlock its bootloader and flash an AOSP based custom ROM to give it some more life. You can find a detailed guide on how to unlock the bootloader here. To find custom ROMs, XDA is the best place to look. There are a few ROMs that's still active, and you can find them here. All instructions and downloads are there in respective ROM threads.

It's been nearly 5 months since i bought it and I still can't get used to it.Also, why when I try to close all apps by clicking (X) in the app manager it brings me back to the app I've opened it from.

Otherwise I see no benefit for doing this.The battery life of my Mi9T is still astonishing, after 20 months. Max 5 crashes in this time, with constant usage.

But when I compare my phone to others with less rams and much worse processors and see how smooth they are and how laggy my phone is I realize that I must flash a custom rom soon.I want to try corvus os but I had some problems with my sim card so I will have to wait until I get a new one. (I don't care about gpay and customisation and this stuff the most important thing for me is performance).,5d
15,"If you like performance, you can flash lineage OS with Google apps, it will be very fast and lightweight!About corvus: this OS may use a custom kernel, which will make phone smoother, but it will totally sacrifice your battery.

16,"My custom ROM adventure started with Redmi Note 3 Pro in 2016. Flashed Android 6 to Android 9 ROMs on it. Performance and battery life were so much better in it than MIUI + the Pixel exclusive goodies like Overview Selection are a blessing in disguise. I started with LineageOS based on Android 6. Next, ValidusOS and ViperOS for Android 7 and CosmicOS for Android 8. Then some ROM (forgot the name) for Android 9. Unfortunately, the battery was swollen and had to sell it. Got Poco X2 (Redmi K30 4G outside India) with Android 10. Last December, I switched to CorvusOS based on Android 11 and till last month, stayed with it but I don't know any proper Pixel Launcher mods that might work in it for Overview Selection and so now am on Pixel Experience Plus. My MagisK only consists of ViperFX and nocutout modules. Going pretty nicely for now :D",5d

If I toggle wifi off and on I can connect again, it can be such a random problem as it can happen repeatedly in a short period of time or it can not happen and seem like everything is OK again.

Quality top phonecameras/entry level DLSR was equal around 2020 and with the rapid advancing phone sensors and computational photography, it's pulling ahead. Unless you want to do a niche like macro or bird photos, the main sensor of phone cameras is highly advanced. There is a lot more money going into mobile camera systems, the sensors, AI, computational algorithms, and that's paying off. The new 1"" 50MP Sony/Samsung sensors are insane, combined with computational photography.My pixel phone (Mi11 is comparable) just smokes my RX100 IV and my D1200 Canon. It's on another level, I sold both. Especially at night, also during the day, the so much higher contrast and true colours are much better. Can't wait to get the much improved Pixel6.Look for any recent DSLR / smartphone comparison on Google to check for yourself.

2,"My Redmi note 5 (whyred) has an miui 12 update, which I think has been in existence for more than a year, and yet Xiaomi has not yet released it. In addition, miui cripples the hardware, by such things as disabling camera2 api, and not allowing multi codec bluetooth support (miui restricts users to sbc, even though the phone has aac, apt-x, and other hi-fi codecs available). That is why I am retiring my note 5, because I am totally fed up with Xiaomi, and their idiotic attempts to copy Apple. I have already purchased a new phone, and it is not a Xiaomi product. I will never buy that brand of mobile phone again.",5d

0,"ROM = Read Only Memory. In Linux terminology, the operating system (OS) is flashed as a read-only memory. Android is based on Linux kernel, and hence uses the same terminology.To flash any ROM, you need access to the bootloader, which is locked by default with almost all manufacturers. So the first step is to unlock the bootloader - with Xiaomi, all you have to do is download the Mi Unlock Tool and follow the instructions. Unlocking is officially supported by Xiaomi, but the only downside is the waiting period (usually 7 days) - but older devices may unlock right away.Once you have an unlocked bootloader, you need to change your stock recovery to a custom one. The stock Mi recovery is pretty basic in nature and only supports flashing stock MIUI ROMs. TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project), OrangeFox, Pitch Black, etc are common custom recoveries. You can flash any, given that it's available and supported for your device. Once done, you can flash anything through this - ROMs, Magisk (for Rooting), any other mods/tweaks.For all this, XDA is the best place to start. Check out your device forum in XDA and you should find all the guides and various custom ROM threads. If you like MIUI, then I'd recommend Xiaomi.eu ROM - it's based on China ROM, but without any ads, bloatware and supports Google services and works well for a global user. Else, you can try out any AOSP (Android Open Source Project) based ROM for a more stock-Android look and feel - just like in Google Pixel or OnePlus devices. XDA should be a great start. 😉",5d

0,"""i have been updating it pretty frequently with whatever update comes out"" -- That's a very very bad idea. The thing about a MiUi update is that you must find what works great for you & your phone, not new = best.""I have no idea on what caused this problem"" -- MiUi 12+ was already creating enough noise in here & you should had read through everything before taking ""whatever"" update.""How can i fix it"" -- First of all check whether your device has ARP (Anti-Rollback Protection) enabled. If it's disabled you can flash older version of MiUi.Sit back and recollect which MiUi update was performing the best on your device & download that. (I won't suggestion going back anymore than 3 updates of the same version of MiUi). If you think MiUi 11 worked great, that's okay.",7d

It supports all the languages, works fully with Google services and works just like the Global ROM, but with no ads, bloatware or Chinese UI elements. The only place that I've seen Chinese characters are in some themes, but that's because the theme is Chinese itself. So other than that, it's perfect for global users.As for the bootloader - yes, theoretically, an unlocked bootloader is less secure, but it's not like someone has direct access to your device. If anyone wants to attack your device, they can do it irrespective of your bootloader status. Xiaomi.eu does support SafetyNet and CTS profile, so you won't have any issues. But some users may have issues with some banking apps (but I've had 0 issues), but there's already workarounds for that available in Xiaomi.eu community. So it should be fine.",8d

7,"I also noticed the grainy issue. I think it is normal for a cheap oled screen/hardware. Btw, the flickering issue will appear if you turn on dark mode, enable 120hz refresh rate and low screen brightness. Switch to 60hz and the flickering issue will disappear.",9d

I might be nitpicking at this point haha!And yea, the flickering appears here and there, mostly when using Youtube in dark mode (not amoled dark mode). And no, it also appears even if my system them is in dark mode. But it doesn't really bother me that much after some reading online about amoled/dc dimming/pwm.And knowing Xiaomi is a big brand, I don't think they will let people hanging since many people have stated this problem, hopefully software update will fix it.

10,"The front of the Note 10 Pro is made of a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 5 display glass that is flush with the plastic frame. The ratio between the display and the front of the device is a good 86% thanks to the comparatively small punch hole and the relatively narrow screen bezels. The only thing that looks a bit protruding is the “chin"".The transition between the bezel and the glass could have been a bit ""rounder"" for our taste, but the design is still a bit angular. There are no compromises in terms of feel thanks to the glass back. Besides our test sample in Onyx Gray, Gradient Bronze and Glacier Blue are available as colour options.Stability and workmanship are at a very appealing level. The built-in buttons in particular sit pleasantly firmly in the frame, and even the power button with the integrated fingerprint sensor, which is often a bit wobbly in smartphones, has almost no amount of play in the Note 10 Pro.",7d

11,I am using mi 11 ultra . Can you tell me how much cpu temperature is normal and when it is overheating ?,11d
12,Woah how did u do that?,11d
13,"You can overclock GPU with few simple steps, you do need to be rooted though.",11d
14,Mi 10T pro is a beast,11d
15,Even the non pro version is fonst,11d
16,"I have a POCO F3 that uses the SD870 which is supposed to be an improved overclocked version of the SD865+, and I'm pretty happy. The performance over time is greater than the SD888 due to the SD888 overheating a lot after a while.",10d
17,I've also tried overclocking poco F3 but overheats like hell unless you underclock cpu like a normal sd 865,10d

1,"Whatsapp's built in camera app is potato anyways, why not just use the camera app?",10d
0,"This phone's been troublesome, I'm not surprised",10d
1,What do you mean by troublesome?,10d
2,"Hmm, we're getting close to redmi note 8t? ;)",10d
3,it will get A11,10d
4,"12.5 currently release only for Global ROM with index MI (V12.5.1.0.RGGMIXM) not IN which is India, you have to wait. Anyway in a case of Xiaomi software updates even when i get new update i wait for some time and read on forums what other peoples experience with it, what if there will be major problems.",10d
5,"just a simple answer, if it available for other people with same device but not yours it mean the rom still in beta stage. just be patient because some people regret the update",10d
6,"it's not beta, it;s just partial update, first they release update for one group of RN8P owners, then for the another part. They do it because if there will be major problems not everyone will get bricked devices.",10d
7,I have the same phone and still waiting. It should come soon to more devices but im not sure.,10d
0,Turn on vibrate on silent mode,10d
1,"Yeah but how, thats why Im asking",10d
2,"How can i fix this and make it go back to normal? Also when i use my finger to unlock my phone it vibrates everytime, before would only vibrate if the finger was not well but now vibrates every single time, is it also possible to fix this?",10d
3,I think it's a bug,10d
4,"There should be a toggle in Settings > Sound & Vibration, Vibrate in Silent Mode. There should also be a toggle in your swipe down quick settings, if not, you can edit those and add it yourself.https://i.imgur.com/zJTEM6F.jpg",10d
5,"You need to look in the settings. I have the same phone it's just something you don't have clicked. And certain apps have ""priority"" and you might have to check notifications for individual apps to see if they have permissions for vibration. I get sounds and vibration. And just vibration depending on what I have on",10d
6,The phone should vibrate when you turn silent mode on. And of course silent mode would go on. That's the point,10d
7,try installint a new os i guess? xiaomi phones suck because of their limitation on everything,10d
8,"bump, im having this exact problem on my RNP9 and i dont think it was like this since the beginning.",10d
0,Chinese rom has a beta branch. Probably everything is based on this.🤷 They probably change it afterwards for each brands.,10d
1,Well I heard that miui 12.5 gives solution to notification problems like push pop up etc because I will be based on xiaomi EU. Maybe you know if this is true?,10d
2,"Every phone has a ROM for a specific region such as Global,Europe etc.You can check on the MIUI version in About phone and see which ROM you have on your device.For more help you can visit this page to learn more about the versions",10d
3,Thanks!,10d
0,Android versions and MIUI versions are mutually exclusive. You got Android 11 based on MIUI 12 now. You should be getting MIUI 12.5 sometime in Q3 2021.,10d
1,"Okay cool, I'm not worried or anything, I was just seeing everyone with 12.5 but I have 11 and 12.0.8.0 which confused me but thank you for clarifying it for me",10d
2,"do not worry,miui12.5 and android 11 is not good combination ,perfect solition miui 11 and android 10",10d
0,Take the back and front off and clean the contacts.🤷 It may or may not work.,10d
0,"Fear mongering, just make sure you download full package not incremental update. To do so, go to update page and press 3 dots on the top right, choose Download latest package",10d
1,how do i do that? is it not just the built in system updater,10d
0,Do you mean Image persistence/screen burn? Something like this?,10d
1,Exactly like this,10d
0,"It is not mandatory, at all. It's just that after any major updates, there will be some redundant files that's still on the system that could result in lags or stutters in the UI. To avoid this, a factory reset is recommended. But for most of the time, you don't have to do it. Just keep this option as your last resort only, since you'll have to reinstall and set up everything after resetting your device.",10d
1,"No, I've never done it on the dozen phones I've owned unless it was a shitty broken nightly Cyanogen or something",10d
0,"Had you tried pressing and holding the power button for 10 second? It will restart the phone.As you had already tried a factory reset, i would suggest you to wait for a new update. Or download the current ROM that the phone has & flash it.If the problem is not solved, download the previous version of the ROM that the phone has & flash it.If it's still not solved, that's a faulty hardware.",10d
1,Thanks yea have tried holding the button down,10d

0,it sounds like this?,10d
1,Sounds more like a loose screw inside. When zoomed in 120 times you can still hear rattling but just a bit quieter.,10d
2,"If you're using the camera, does the sound go away? If it does, it's just the floating part of the camera that gets activated when using it (OIS?). Try using each camera lens and shake your phone to see if the sound goes away. You may have noticed it just recently because the sound is very faint but once you notice it, you notice it everytime.",10d
3,That's the Camera OIS. It's normal.,7d
0,"I already have it in my Mi 10T Pro since one week ago, I'm in Europe. They usually do gradual rollouts in these things so if an update goes wrong they can stop it before it gets to everyone.",11d
1,Is the update worth it?,10d
2,12.5 is just overhyped update...i havent seen a single benefit on my mi 10 after receiving it.,11d
3,"Fixed a lot of bugs for me, like notifications dissapearing, status bar icons turning black in dark mode if the wallpaper was too light (it still does this but it's less aggresive, I can use brighter wallpapers now), the lockscreen wallpaper randomly looking either too dark and with serious banding or too bright and washed out, the background becoming unblurred when going back from an app to a folder by swiping Home, the screen flickering when unlocking the phone from the lockscreen. Oh and now you can actually swipe notifications up to snooze upcoming notifications from that respective app, which was missing for some reason. It even added a slight haptic feedback when locking the phone. It was surprisingly good, honestly. It's just as smooth as before 🤷",10d
4,So according to Xiaomi Support on twitter (I asked) the Mi 10T Pro MI version will get the update this quarter. Good news is the update is not suspended as some rumors are saying. Bad news is it's 1 quarter late lolol,7d
5,Redmi note 7 got it yesterday... I have Redmi note 10... for my device there's no information.,11d
6,"Now they are probably having problems with their update server. Half a day I try to download EEA software for this model but the bigota.d.miui server probably does not work, only 4 out of 5 gigabytes of the file is downloaded",11d
7,It says in the website Mi 10t Pro will be in the first batch to be updated. Lol. MiUI 12.5 website,11d
8,12.5 is not really much xiaomi really overhyped the update. Miui 12.5 is basically some small improvements and bug fixing not really much of any new features miui 12 already had,10d
9,"Super wallpaper menu is not available in this update also, if anyone has received it then please help.",3d
0,"I have this issue too sometimes. It's usually the phone app, the install and uninstall windows and sometimes it's the settings.",10d
1,Maybe show a video of your issue,10d
0,Maybe check if WhatsApp have permission to read,11d
1,"Backup WhatsApp to gdrive, clear data and restore backup",11d
2,Is it the right way? I've the same problem and I've seen that the photos are still present in the gallery. But for newer media there's a new folder,10d
3,I just updated and have no issues.,10d
4,How you have 12.5 on your 9T Pro alreayd? Been here hitting the search for updates button for weeks hoping to have 12.5 available and see what exciting new bugs and glitches it will bring for my phone and still on 12.0.4... 😖,10d
0,"My mi 10 has an anti-flicker mode which I've turned off and ~90fps (I use it at ~60fps). Probably the anti-flicker mode is available to many other models.🤷 (Mi 10 has an oled screen, ~dunno what of screen has less pwm.)",10d
