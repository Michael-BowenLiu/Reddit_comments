Been an android user from the beginning. I now am using an iPhone 8. Honestly the best choice I have made in years.  Quality of build is amazing and user experience is top notch.   Don‚Äôt know why i didn‚Äôt do this before.  And the best part?  Actual updates that fix things.   I don‚Äôt have to wait till the android maker decides to send out an update,0.0,0.77,0.23,0.9517

"Honestly, I've been used an iPhone for the past 5 years, and I'm ready to go back.I have a Galaxy S8 I use with a second line, and if someone were to rob me to steal a phone from me, I'd give them the iPhone before I gave up the Galaxy.I've never disliked my iPhone more after anincident: I'm missing simple shit like picture-in-picture YouTube (I pay for that), app multitasking, default apps (I rely on Chrome -- stop sending everything to Safari) USB-C... and the most important thing -- no app restarting!The incident was: if I leave YouTube for a second just to check my messages in WhatsApp (I don't use Messages), I don't want to come back to YouTube and see the app reloading. Every time. Every single time.  If I want it to not reload, I have to leave the video playing and then scroll back. I've never experienced this with the Galaxy. And this happens with almost every app. Facebook, Reddit... I lose my place constantly and it's annoying. On the Galaxy I can wake up and be right where I was before I went to sleep -- even YouTube will reopen the video and I will be right where I was.What sealed the deal for me was... when my sister bought an S20 FE, took her watch off, and put it on the back of the S20 FE to charge. And it charged.Gimmicky, I know, but then I realized that Samsung / Android had surpassed my iPhone long ago, in ways I could never imagine.

"I'm in the opposite boat. Long time apple user, even worked at a store for 6 years. Back on May 1st, I had an issue with music sharing from my account to my wife's. I spent over 12 hours speaking with reps on chat and senior reps over the phone. They never resolved my issue or followed up with me even after trying to resolve the issue well into June. By the middle of May I gave up and got a free Adroid from T-mobile. The main thing I miss is the polish and consistency of the user interface and design language along with the stability of the operating system.What I don't miss is buying an expensive luxury device and being treated like I bought an entry level samsung. Now I have an entry level samsung and at least I can't get pissed off when they give me apple quality support since at least I'll actually be getting what I paid for.Edit: Forgot to add that I was certified in iOS repair.",0.027,0.861,0.112,0.9398

Currently, besides different screen sizes and finishes, the high-end and low-end iPhones share the same fundamental ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå design.

"Strongly disagree, and I honestly believe the camera is one of the weakest parts of the iPhone. Pictures are made to look good on the iPhone screen but as soon as you take them off the phone and resize them they look awful.The oil painting effect is incredibly strong on iPhones to make up for the low megapixel sensor, so when you take a picture you took in iPhone and do a print larger than A3 or use it as a wallpaper on a computer it immediately looks terrible. Detail is lost almost immediately if you are taking a landscape photo, the land itself is a blurry mess.I have a 12ProMax and the issue is still glaring.

Plenty of github open sourced projects can then easily be installed by the end user. Indeed, if they link the capability to access github projects and build on the iPad/iPhone, even better.Of course, I know what this will ultimately lead to, Anti-virus vendors will want to sell you a subscription based application that can scan the file before you side load it onto your device.I can see this will allow us to have applications that are currently not allowed.

"So I recently switched from a Samsung to a 12 Pro Max and there are some things to say:PROS:UX/UI is just better, not only from a subjective view but the way most apps follow some standards and the integration of different elements (ex. gesture bar background is always transparent as opposed to Android, notification bar is always merged...).Apps and OS makes full use of device's hardware. You can notice the way your devices makes use of all your hardware, haptic engine, camera, LiDAR... (when i say camera for example you can test an iphone camera quality on the native camera app and other app like instagram, whatsapp... and do the same test on android and realize the conflict android project has to beat that is being the best OS for any hardware).Siri is way useful than Ok Google/Google Now, even though Ok Google is more ""intelligent"" and that when it comes to information it is way more accurate, Siri has more abilities system wide than its counterpart, for example I can tell her to send a whatsapp message, change settings options and more.

If this was iPhone, you'd move the documents into folders but your desk would still have 50 documents on it.iPhone forces you to organize pictures how they want instead of how you want.

"from the article:When we set out earlier this year to reimagine Firefox for desktop to be simpler, more modern and faster to use, we didn‚Äôt forget about your Apple mobile devices. We use our laptops and computers for work and play, but our tablets and phones sit a lot closer. They‚Äôre the first screens we see in the morning, and the last we see before we go to bed.Firefox is only one of the many apps you use throughout the day, so our browser can‚Äôt just look good. It also needs to feel at home. The newest Firefox for iOS and iPadOS represents what we think online life should be: fast, beautiful and private ‚Äì presented in a package that looks and feels intuitive and natural.It‚Äôs fastYou can already one-tap to go to your top sites, and we‚Äôve brought the same speed to search. Every time Firefox or a new tab opens, the keyboard will now come up, ready for you to start searching right away.When typing takes too long, you can build search suggestions word by word.Firefox syncs your bookmarks, history, passwords and more between devices. But when you have many tabs open on your iPhone, iPad and computer, they‚Äôre often hard to find. Now you can simply start typing the tab‚Äôs name, and Firefox will show the tabs you have opened, no matter where they‚Äôre located.And if you don‚Äôt quite know what something is called, you can browse for it easily. Open the main application menu, and all your bookmarks, history, downloads and reading list are there.It‚Äôs beautifulWe‚Äôve rebuilt parts of Firefox in native components, making it feel more iPhone and iPad-like than ever before. You‚Äôll notice design elements that look and work identically to those found in many other apps, so our browser feels instantly familiar. We‚Äôve also taken a major step up in accessibility. Firefox now supports more text sizes and integrates better with screen readers.Our menus take up less space and work like all other menus you‚Äôre used to.All your tabs, including ones synced from other devices, now appear side by side. And your bookmarks, history, downloads and reading list are browsed just like tabs do. Switching between them is a breeze.And we‚Äôve given Firefox for iPadOS the same productivity-inspired new tab design, simplified navigation and streamlined menus. Your favourite browser now looks and feels consistent, no matter where you are.It‚Äôs privateThe App Store now includes app privacy labels that help you understand our data collection practices.Here‚Äôs what we collect and why:When you sign into your Firefox account with your email, you‚Äôll receive updates about all the awesome things happening at Mozilla in your inbox. You can manage your Newsletter subscriptions here. You may choose to share information about feature usage, crashes and other technical data with us. We collect them, but we do not link them to your Firefox account identity! This information helps us improve Firefox performance and stability, and to support our marketing. You can read more about it here. What‚Äôs next for FirefoxWe‚Äôre excited to share a fast, beautiful and private Firefox experience across all your devices.

Funny thing is the video you can take is probably best in class quality, and beats any other phone I've tried.My primary problem comes down to the sensor size being so small and the oil painting effect, both of which feed into each other. I know MP isn't everything, but only being 12MP is losing out on so much detail, and that kind of feeds into the oil painting effect. They are having to do so much processing on the low sensor size that if you zoom in everything looks like a blurry mess.

Most of the time it's a relatively random effect that affects some percentage of devices.

Now, if only 10% of a specific model have that issue, that is already a gigantic deal for Apple; it's millions of people complaining and millions of devices to replace - but for the buyer, you still have a 90% chance of getting a device that's perfectly fine.So what you do is you buy it anyway, but before you start using it heavily you make sure to very closely check that everything is working ok.

After being in the Android ecosystem for so long and recently switching to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. All I can say it‚Äôs basically the same thing. Yeah you get some differences here and there but you navigate pretty similarly. Something I‚Äôve always heard from people though is they say iPhone is super stable. But I‚Äôve actually had more app crashes in iPhone than Android. And I do miss things like app multitasking. Real multitasking and being able to close apps but still having them running. Like phone app when doing calls. Or even the notifications. Got pretty used to doing a lot through notifications and not needing to open the app. But other than that I like both ecosystems. Oh. And customization. I enjoy pretty minimal looks. Which is not easy to do with iPhone unless you mess around with shortcuts and transparent widgets. Something I won‚Äôt understand after messing around with both. Is why Apple is seen so high. I enjoy iphone. Might get the iphone 13. But a lot has to do too because I got bored of using the same ecosystem for so many years. But that‚Äôs just me. Something I do recommend is don‚Äôt lock yourself on the Apple ecosystem if possible. I heard people having so much trouble switching because of this. Link everything to google if possible on iphone. I am able to switch seem less because of this,0.056,0.778,0.166,0.9853

This hurt the brand so badly that they don‚Äôt even use the name Samsung in Japan, they only use Galaxy 3: when they entered the Japanese market they built a strategy in which they partnered with the Japanese carrier SoftBank and ran an incredible aggressive add campaign to advertise the iPhone and attract customers and it became one of the cheapest on the Japanese market.credit to Apple Explained on yt",0.089,0.823,0.088,-0.2956

"This is a rabbit hole. I don't blame you for wanting a simple explanation.The TL;DR, thankfully, is extremely easy.What is lossless audio?The uncompromised audio straight from the mastering engineer/production team. That's it. That's all it is.What do you mean uncompromised? Is my audio compromised?!No need to be alarmed! Because internet speed hasn't always been super amazing (still isn't in lots of places), and lots of people generally can't tell the difference audibly, streaming services generally use lossy audio formats to deliver your music. In Apple Music's case, this format is AAC, and much like MP3, OGG (used by Spotify sometimes), etc., some data is removed when these are made. This lowers the file size and allows them to be delivered pretty easily, but at the cost of lowering the quality from the original source.In contrast, lossless formats like FLAC and ALAC (the latter being the format Apple will use for the new lossless tiers) don't delete any audio data to lower the file size ‚Äì they simply look for redundant information and store it in a more efficient way than the original uncompressed format (WAV or AIFF) delivered by the artist/label. So when you play these files, it sounds exactly the same as the original source because no audio data was removed.What's the difference between Lossless tier and Hi-Resolution Lossless tier?Apple mobile devices generally don't support sample rates higher than 48kHz, but high resolution masters can go all the way up to 192kHz. Most Apple computers are capable of 96kHz if not 192k, so those are fine for the hi-res tier, but to use that on your iPhone, you'd need to buy a DAC and plug it into your lightning port to use anything higher than 48k. This is the most practical reason why they are offering two tiers ‚Äì if you only use your 48k-max mobile device and don't want to buy a DAC, just use the normal lossless tier.Sample rate is a highly technical thing to explain, but the most important thing to understand is that half of the sample rate number is the highest possible frequency the sample rate can reproduce fully. That means 44.1kHz ‚Äì the most common sample rate and the one we hear exclusively on every CD ever manufactured ‚Äì reproduces up to 22.05kHz properly, and humans with the best hearing only hear up to 20kHz, so that's perfectly covering our hearing range without compromise.Wait. So if 44.1k delivers everything fine, what's with the higher numbers?Uh, well, it's complicated. There are benefits and drawbacks during production to using higher sample rates. For the end consumer buying the music, it's entirely possible you will not only hear no difference at all between the lossless 44.1k files and anything >44.1k, but also that you may hear no difference from normal Apple Music AAC files to lossless either! A lot of factors determine audible differences, including the hardware you're using, but ultimately it comes down to your hearing and how developed that is. Mastering engineers who have perfectly tuned rooms and expensive speakers ‚Äì and wear earplugs when they go out to buy groceries ‚Äì can hear the difference, and in the technical sense there is absolutely a difference, but that doesn't mean you will detect it yourself.So why would I even want this if I might not hear the difference?I mean, maybe you don't. That's why it's great that it doesn't cost extra ‚Äì the benefits of a service run by a highly profitable company. But you should give it a try, since it seems you can switch it back at any time, which is important if your internet connection can't handle the larger amount of data this takes. Same for storage on your mobile device.The biggest thing is to be honest about trying it. Try not to let big numbers and hype influence you, and do your test with music you really know well, inside out: your favourite songs that you've heard ten million times on all kinds of headphones and speakers. You're more likely to notice a difference because memory is an important part of how we hear, just like our physical health, the room in which we listen, and the equipment with which we listen. And if you don't hear a difference, be honest with yourself, and save your internet connection some strain by switching it back.If you wanna try a blind test with neutral music you've never heard before, there's plenty of websites set up to do that (don't do it on YouTube!) that are a Google search away.Why is this even a thing if people might not hear a difference? That's dumb!You can say a lot of things about lossless audio, but one thing it isn't is dumb ‚Äì or, rather, it isn't dumb for people who sell audio, because plenty of people have not only bought lossless music in other formats, but also re-bought other music they already owned in lossy formats! So if anything, it'd be dumb of any streaming service not to offer lossless if they can afford to do so, just from a practical business standpoint. Big numbers and marketing terms like ""studio quality"" offer money in return. Granted, Apple isn't asking for more money for these tiers, and that's cool: in their case, it's more like further marketing to promote Apple Music to people who don't yet have it, or are considering switching from other services.Plus, I mean, there are people that can hear it. There's also the argument that consumers deserve the opportunity to purchase music at its original quality level as an option, regardless of audibility or any other factor.Also, what's Dolby Atmos?Surround sound, essentially. Dolby has come out with the newest form of this, called Atmos, and one of the coolest things about it is that it's able to be heard not only in wild 7.2.4 setups with speakers everywhere, but also in normal Apple earpods, and even some speakers! So Apple is adding this tech to the service at the same time as the lossless tiers. Only the releases with the Atmos logo on the album details page will be mixed this way. It's compatible with the vast majority of devices, because Atmos is scalable, and plays on regular headphones as binaural surround.Is Dolby Atmos the same thing as Spatial Audio?No! Even though some of the messaging as made it would like it is. Spatial Audio is a specific form of Dolby Atmos that requires a movement tracker chip in your headphones/speakers; using this, the surround sound elements will stay in the same place when you move your head/the speaker. So if you look forward and the vocals are coming from that direction in your headphones, but then you look to the right, you'll hear the vocals on your left. Note that you need compatible hardware (""all AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, speakers in the latest versions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac"" according to the announcement... no deets about other brands yet).",0.031,0.851,0.118,0.9988

"What is lossless audio? The uncompromised audio straight from the mastering engineer/production team. That's it. That's all it is.That's not really true. Lossless refers to the data being the same after being compressed and uncompressed. It doesn't mean there is no data compression. All lossless codecs use data compression, except linear PCM and equivalent.",0.082,0.885,0.033,-0.4308
"ELI5 version: Digital music can be either lossless or lossy. Lossless music includes 100% of the bits of the song. Lossy uses algorithms to remove repetitive bits of the song.The music you've been listening to on Apple Music doesn't include all the bits of the song. But technology has gotten so good in the last 20 years that it's very difficult to tell.Over the years, technology has given portability and better than average sound quality for the masses. You used to have to buy heavy amplifiers and stationary speakers (and records) to listen to anything other than a transistor radio. You used to have to be an audiophile. Now everyone has music in their pockets or on their wrists so audiophile (lossless) quality has been less important.I think Apple Music gaining lossless music is just a byproduct of them pushing Spatial Audio. It keeps them (very) competitive with other services that offer upgraded lossless audio plans. For instance, Tidal gets $20 for everything Apple is now including for $10. We're sure to see more Apple products including these audio features and I'd put money on a partner program so other manufacturers can play nice with proprietary Apple APIs. Again, like Tidal does.Will you hear the difference? Not likely without upgraded equipment.",0.036,0.844,0.119,0.9695

"It's literally CD quality audio. Like the same sample rate every CD has, the same dumb CDs you were playing in your Chevy Cavalier back in high school. Then streaming and iTunes came along and they only offered lossy formats, of the same sample rate but a compressed bitrate, which lowers the file size at the expense of quality using formats like AAC or MP3 or Ogg Vorbis (Spotify). FLAC and ALAC are examples of lossless (CD quality) formats which retain everything. The higher-res sample rates (24 bit at 96 KHz for example) can also be contained within FLAC and ALAC. However going from 24/96 to 16/44.1 sample rate (CD) only results in a higher noise floor that is usually imperceptible anyway, with detail loss above the range of human hearing; these changes are less perceptible than going from lossy to lossless.",0.075,0.882,0.043,-0.5927

The ELI5 is like you know when you're watching Netflix and the video sometimes gets blocky / static-y?

The iPhone 4 was the first iPhone I would have considered getting, and only because I was 16 and couldn‚Äôt afford it that I never got it.
