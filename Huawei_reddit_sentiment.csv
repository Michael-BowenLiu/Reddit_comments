P30pro is great. Had mine for 2 years! You won't regret it!,0.0,0.562,0.438,0.7915
"The GT2 Pro has 98% functionality with other Android manufacturers devices. Off the top of my head, you'd only be losing the remote shutter feature, as that requires EMUI. You can answer calls on other Android manufacturers devices, so I'm not sure where the statement that it's only Huawei devices came from.I think the P30 Pro is still a very solid device. I'm hoping it stays with me for another two years, but I really don't care about updates or features which I will only use once or twice, that you see on newer Android versions so I'm completely fine with sticking on Android 10. So it depends on how you feel about that too.5G situation is similar for me, no 5G yet but LTE is plenty fast for what I use mobile internet for. 5G is good for the infrastructure, but my personal use means it's not required yet.Given that the Mate 20 Pro and the P30 Pro are both using EMUI 11, if you want a change of scenery it wouldn't be the worst decision. Whether you would like to learn a different interface, or stick with what you know. You have the synergy with your laptop too, and whilst MSC has some uses, it's very convenient to transfer files wirelessly at the speed that Huawei Share offers",0.043,0.857,0.1,0.91

Samsungs long-time durability is nothing compared to Huaweis. I can assure that: my sis still has a mate 8 and its still absolutely fluid (she doesn't use it anymore because she wanted a change). After that she got an S9 and she was so fucked up because of the deflating battery and the fluidity was gone. So the mate 8 still runs better than her newer S9 lmao. Now she got an iPhone because she wanted to keep GMS but she thought about getting a huawei as well.,0.037,0.865,0.098,0.5333

But, you can downgrade your phone and sideload GMS, as I have now. The main problem with sideloaded GMS is that you miss notifications. I get only once a day Gmail notifications. No reddit notifications. Some Play Store notifications. I only have sideloaded GMS because I've bought some apps on Play Store, so I need to have it. If you have no paid apps, you can use just Petal Search. You can find almost everything there. And Huawei Store is quite big.

Youtube also doesn't work for me unless I use dual space and browser I think. I don't trust the petal search alone because I prefer having apps be at one place since I feel like there is less chance of malware that way or compromised data banks. Most apps come from the Apkpure store, which someone has said got compromised before. Tho to this fact, maybe someone more tech savvy can say if I'm right or wrong to think that. The huawei Appgallery is also not really well stocked in the moment if you ask me.  I mostly stick to the apps I already use on my phone(mate 10) and just download those. I'm not gonna lie, I find it very inconvenient. I worry I'll need a new phone soon, had this one for 3+ years now and just today it started horribly overheating which it never did, and this whole situation does make me hesitant to get another Huawei device despite having great experiences with my current model.

The AppGalley has 98% of what I need & with Chinas position as the largest mobile phone consumers/users it pretty much a no brainier business decision.Currently Huawei is at that same point as Windows Mobile, their app store is what's going to determine whether HarmonyOS is successful or not. It isn't Huawei, it's the app developers (who also make a lot of their apps unnecessarily GMS dependant).Personally I find posts like this hilarious. What's happened isn't a secret.

"Nothing of this has happened out of the free will of Huawei. If they sell phones and claim ""You can install Google Services, regarless of the ban"" it is a promise, and one they simply can't hold true forever because it is much easier for Google to prevent this from happening than for Huawei to make it happen. Huawei has decided to participate in a game which is dominated by one company on the software side. Relations like these always have huge risks and sometimes, as happened in that case, they will leave one party with a massive damage. And btw., just be cause I've read it a few times now, selling them Huawei phones dirt cheap in the western world is not an option, since they could be reimported to China easily and hurt Huawei even more. They still have a market of potentially 1.5 billion customers, although hurt, they'll survive.",0.126,0.761,0.113,-0.4993
"OK lets address your points one by oneHuawei dont need to make any claims about installing Google. Like you quite correctly point out, it'd be at best a legal liability and more realistically brand damaing.What huawei can do is this. Make it easier for devs to create custom roms and apps to allow users to get around the ban.Google can circumvent Huawei and they have an interest in doing so - their pixel phone business only stands to gain if Huawei is out of the picture, so yes I agree with you there.Huawei had no choice but participate in a game dominated by one company, if any SE asian phone maker wants to break into western market, they pretty much have to embrace an open source ecosystem that has momentum in the west. Samsung tried otherwise with Tizen and failed....I am not sure how reimporting phones back into china will hurt Huawei - the overall volume of reimported phones is likely to be tiny and given the price difference between a Huawei phone in the US and China, Huawei would have to massively discount the phone to the point where they were taking a sizeable loss.Yes they do have a market of 1.5billion, but they also employ thousands of people in the west and that will cause misery for many.....Sometimes what seems obvious isnt....",0.063,0.821,0.116,0.7881

"Well apart from downgrading to emui 10.1.131 and installing the play store and update from there, yes gspace is a convenient way to use apps that absolutely require GMS. Nonetheless you can use a virtual machine that will get you into a shell of another phone in your phone such as VPhoneGaga or VMOS. Gspace is just easier on the eyes, but that's about it, although it does count in terms of practicality, as you don't have to enter a phone in your phone to operate some apps, as with gspace, you can create some bookmarks on your home page.And if you choose a third party launcher Nova, or any of your liking, you can use the swipe down from anywhere. If you are keen on emui there's a trick I have found which is that if you have day Nova installed, but emui launcher as the primary launcher, then you can select and add a nova action widget like pull down notification tray or quick settings. That way, you won't be able to slide, but you'll get a button easy enough to reach to pull it 8n the press of the finger.

"Basically, the way lithium ion battery technology works, it is best to only ever occasionally let the battery completely drain and be charged up to 100% as it puts more strain on the cells. It is recommended to not let a battery drop below 20% or charge above 80% the majority of the time to keep the battery in best health. However it is good to do a full drain and recharge every so often to affectively recalibrate all of the cells to avoid the first and last to charge/drain from becoming lost or unusable. It's a technology that is still constantly in development but these li-ion batteries are currently by far the most cost effective and practical for phones and laptops. Features like this are there to help preserve battery lifespan for those who charge overnight still, where in practice you should do 2 quick charges a day to see you through and make your device last as long as possible without needing a battery replacement",0.048,0.832,0.12,0.9297

"Mate 40 Pro user here. It all depends you, how much do you depend on GMS. I have all my relevant apps installed either from AppGallery or from Aurora Store.I was able to instal GMaps(they work), Google Chrome, I use Gboard as my main keyboard and GAuthenticator(all my tokens are saved on it). Those are the main GApps that I use.For the Mail app the native one does the job but you can use BlueMail available from the Aurora Store. Don't use any kind of assistant neither have I used before.The biggest downside is the notifications not being shown on apps dependent on GMS, however there is a fix for that it was posted on Huawei Community forum also on Huaweiblog.de I am happy with my choice and am not planing to switch to another brand just because it lacks GMS.Harmony OS looks promising, haven't received the update same as all international users, looking forward to it. The UI looks more polished hopefully we get battery optimisations and they unlock the bootloader.The display is crisp and vibrant which I love, the curves are not to everyones liking, even for myself switching from Mate 20 Pro it took me few days to adjust to the curvature. Stereo loudspeakers awesome cameras 66W charger which will come in handy if you are in a rush with low battery.Overall a great phone and a good looking phone, you'll definetely notice by yourself because in a world full of Sammies and iSheep the boldness of the design on this phone just is way above them",0.028,0.81,0.162,0.9923

That might be true. But it would be weird to just end software updates of HarmonyOS that they switch to with their newer flagships and older flagships devices.

Newer flagships that get HarmonyOS earlier than the older ones should also get updates for 2 years minimum for some devices. It would be weird if they won't.,0.057,0.917,0.026,-0.296

"I still can't believe that companies design their products in such a way that makes them unusable in advertised use-cases.No. It's not my job to look after a mobile PC by not treating it as one.

They're tools to get a given job done and if they're poorly designed then Huawei doesn't deserve my money.Your mindset is incredibly anti-consumer, so I hope you see that now and if something you have doesn't serve you, and it's supposed to handle that given problem, you need to return it.The fact that this issue only occurs when the device is charging is a further indicator that this has to do with the battery and heat dissipation. My CPU is set to 70% of its allowed target clocks, so if the chassis cannot handle the 60W charger they should have added a toggle to disable fast-charging.",0.025,0.942,0.033,0.3538
