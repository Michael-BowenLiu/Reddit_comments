You should go for realme x7 max it's 27000 rupess in India which is around 360 USD . And the price to performance ratio is insane. You get amoled display with 120 hz refresh rate. Dimensity 1200 which is equivalent to Snapdragon 865 but remember you will not get good custom rom support on this processor. 4500 mah battery with 50w wired charging and decent camera  that you can expect from a mid range phone. But overall in the market this is the best a phone can offer right now in my opinion for a price of 360 USD,0.047,0.864,0.089,0.75
Maybe you could get a Budget little higher + few bucks.  U could try Poco F2 Pro overall its great phone. Miui 12.5.1 fiexd some issues with ram management so its  its nice but  could be better.

It can and it should, easily facilitate the use of 3rd party launchers - Google even introduced a new API for 3rd party launchers to make the task switching transition smoother in Android 11 - it works great on pretty much every phone where the stock launcher is based on a current Launcher3 core.

This will break so much stuff, some permanently until a factory reset, on MIUI 12 that it should never, ever be touched by the user and the feature has been removed from current versions of MIUI entirely.The correct, and not too difficult, way is to simply sideload via ADB which is still possible, see Option C here:https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanced/wiki/installation/#wiki_option_c.3AThere is no workaround for the Nova Launcher issue besides using button navigation. Xiaomi failed to implement API changes in their stock launcher(s) to allow full and unrestricted use of 3rd party Launchers.

"Blame Google for making changes in A11 that no one wanted, or asked for.Before Android 11 Xiaomi used a long deprecated, ugly, fallback to allow gesture navigation with 3rd party launchers, Google communicated its removal well in advance. Yet when it happened it took Xiaomi by so much surprise that it took them several updates to just disable the ability to even use gesture navigation with 3rd gesture navigation (which, before the update, simply left users stranded with no functional navigation at all).Now you might be wondering: Is this API exclusive to Google Pixel phones? The answer is no, it isn’t. The API is part of Launcher3/QuickStep and can be found in AOSP, meaning it’s open to any OEM launcher app. While the API was committed to Launcher3 internally on July 21, 2020, it seems it was merged into the AOSP master branch with the Android R QPR1 release in December.Task-switching and gestures are part of the stock Launcher in current Android versions. It can, it should, easily facilitate the use of 3rd party launchers - in fact, it does on most Android devices: it works better than ever on Google Pixel devices, it works great on Samsung phones, it works great on pretty much every phone where the stock launcher is based on a current Launcher3 core. Just not on MIUI.Xiaomi is the odd one out here. They didn't update their launchers (MIUI or Poco Launcher) and the didn't and still don't give a crap about third party launchers.This isn't difficult to implement, this is a well documented AOSP Android feature they could and should implement in MIUI. They chose not to.So, could you explain to me again why exactly this is Google's fault and not Xiaomi's?The YouTube Vanced issue is another MIUI-exclusive feature. MIUI 12 actively prevents sideloading of split-apks (and only split apks, classic ones still sideload fine) for dog knows what fucking reason. The Xioami.EU mod removed this ""feature"" in their builds, but all official ROMs are stuck with it.The only sensible way is to sideload via ADB, which is still possible for now.Official instructions here (use Option C): https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanced/wiki/installation/#wiki_option_c.3AThe alternative of disabling MIUI Optimizations not only breaks and ungodly amount of shit in MIUI, often irreversible so (only a factory reset will fix it), the feature has also been removed in most current stock ROMs for that very reason.And, yes, of course Youtube Vanced work just fine on Android 11, the github issue you linked is completely unrelated to OPs problem. This is, again, a MIUi 12 problem.

"Comparable. For anything other than pro DSLR users, smartphone took over. But portability and ease of use is so much better, that it's an easy contest. Quality top phonecameras/entry level DLSR was equal around 2020 and with the rapid advancing phone sensors and computational photography, it's pulling ahead. Unless you want to do a niche like macro or bird photos, the main sensor of phone cameras is highly advanced. There is a lot more money going into mobile camera systems, the sensors, AI, computational algorithms, and that's paying off. The new 1"" 50MP Sony/Samsung sensors are insane, combined with computational photography.My pixel phone (Mi11 is comparable) just smokes my RX100 IV and my D1200 Canon. It's on another level, I sold both. Especially at night, also during the day, the so much higher contrast and true colours are much better.

"ROM = Read Only Memory. In Linux terminology, the operating system (OS) is flashed as a read-only memory. Android is based on Linux kernel, and hence uses the same terminology.To flash any ROM, you need access to the bootloader, which is locked by default with almost all manufacturers. So the first step is to unlock the bootloader - with Xiaomi, all you have to do is download the Mi Unlock Tool and follow the instructions. Unlocking is officially supported by Xiaomi, but the only downside is the waiting period (usually 7 days) - but older devices may unlock right away.Once you have an unlocked bootloader, you need to change your stock recovery to a custom one. The stock Mi recovery is pretty basic in nature and only supports flashing stock MIUI ROMs. TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project), OrangeFox, Pitch Black, etc are common custom recoveries. You can flash any, given that it's available and supported for your device. Once done, you can flash anything through this - ROMs, Magisk (for Rooting), any other mods/tweaks.For all this, XDA is the best place to start. Check out your device forum in XDA and you should find all the guides and various custom ROM threads. If you like MIUI, then I'd recommend Xiaomi.eu ROM - it's based on China ROM, but without any ads, bloatware and supports Google services and works well for a global user. Else, you can try out any AOSP (Android Open Source Project) based ROM for a more stock-Android look and feel - just like in Google Pixel or OnePlus devices. XDA should be a great start. 😉",0.009,0.838,0.153,0.9923
