0,"I've had a p40 5g lite for a little over a day now (sent by the insurance company ) , and it's a great phone but I'm sending it back as soon as the p30 is back in stock, its the the apps that are the issue it little ones that I take for granted like the local bus company one, greggs, even pokemon go is incompatible and it seems quite a few of the pub ones all need gms, which is,l such a shame as it seems such a capable phone",8h
1,Wow. I didn't think it would be that serious. Now I understand why there's such a big fuss going on without GMS. Thanks!,8h
2,It's a non issue for me. I have a couple of apps that say won't work without Google services but if I click OK they continue to work!,6h

6,"I'm assuming it's making non Huawei users integrated in Google ecosystem harder to port over.

7,Ya you do have a point here. Thanks for your answer!,9h
8,"Mate 40 Pro user here. No GMS. The overall experience is 99% perfect, but, this 1% is really painful. For example, Uber / Wheely using Google Maps in order to request a taxi and... on the Mate 40 Pro I simply can't use this apps. No other problems at all, but this rare scenarios... They can create a lot of problems at the most inopportune moment.",5h
9,"Well, you can't buy anything in any games, no in game payment for wildrift, cod, pubg, nothing. All payments are through gpay. You can't have in app purchase for any app.I use carista to diagnose my car and customize it. You can't buy credits for it cause in app payment is through gpay.Glovo and foodpanda won't work (maybe something related to gms and gmaps) and many similar apps. Well...to be honest, i actually don't know a similar app that works.Some older but usefull apps or games won't start without gms.But overall it's fine. I always find a workaround. I paid 500€ for P40 Pro, with those money the best I could get was Xiaomi MI 10T Pro with ips display, so this p40 pro was best bang for the bucks at the time i bought it. Worth the struggle for this beast camera setup & overall performance and build quality. But I'd never buy it at full price. I'm not kinda a fan of brands anyway. I choose everytime best performance / price for anything tech related.",3h
10,"For me, it's a no go without Google. For one, I am all in on Google services for my life and then a lot (really a lot) of the most used apps in my country do require some sorte of Google services to operate, even some that I can't understand why. I am a happy Huawei fan for a long time. The hardware and software is solid but am currently watching (and delaying) my next smartphone purchase because of this.",2h

1,Any news/updates on global devices?,7h
2,aslong as it is not global im not interesstet anymore in this os,just now
0,Its the p50 launch and is global but not for all markets. Sadly Huawei NZ could not get retailers to range this product in NZ so it isnt launching here... they also couldnt get e-sim support for the watch 3 so it isnt launching in NZ either....,1d
1,idk about NZ but Huawei does not officially sell phones here in the US either but that doesn't stop a third-party phone retailer from doing it and so they are all over Amazon and they work fine in the US. Never had a problem buying or using one despite Huawei not officially selling them here.,1d
2,Just import it.,15h

11,Huawei heard us. bringing the first largest sensor to us! :),20h
12,"Yes, this is true",18h

14,What about Canada?,11h
0,Cases look nice but holy fuck could the cameras be more ugly this yearwouldn't even be mad this time if the case blocked from seeing those horrible things,15h
1,I liked the leaks where its 2 giant black circles. Looks better like that then being able to actually see the lens,15h
2,"That cameras brutal, why not just stick with a rectangle one",15h
3,Nahh i like that its different. But they should have made the individual lenses extremely hard to see. Would have looked better,15h

1,well that sucks. but can you at least lower it?,1d
2,"Soory bro, you cannot hide the page indicator in huawei home but you can use other free third-party launchers. My recommendation for you is to download lawnchair v2 launcher. You can really customize everything you want in it and you can also remove that page indicator in it",23h

1,AGRY 100000000% I'm S21 user afther 3 years od using Huawei devices!,58m
2,You don't have to upgrade and trust me it's certainly not free.,1d
3,"no, had an s20+ and switched te a p40 pro, happy since :)",22h
4,Not really....  Small upgrades in screen and features (wireless charging)Downgrade in camera and battery life.Plus (in my opinion) a fairly worse UI.,1d
5,You've clearly not used a P30 recently. The camera quality now is poor compared to when it was first released,1d
6,"Normal p30 ain't that great camera wise, the S20 is most definitely better with the camera",23h
7,my p30 has wireless charging?,15h
8,"If you want to upgrade and need GMS, then go for it. If you want to upgrade to Huawei, go for the Mate or P40 pro+.",22h
9,"no the S20 is a terrible phone. Its camera isnt a patch on the P30's (especially when zoomed out or at night), and the S20's battery sucks dog balls.It is also stupidly expensive and survives because of the money spend by Samsung on advertising.Look at a One+, Xiaomi, Meizu or Oppo.....",15h
10,S20 is better in every way except in terms of battery life. It is just bad battery life (used Exynos version).,18h
11,"no it isnt. The Exynos runs hotter, has worse battery life. The camera performs badly at night, struggles with auto focus and lacks enough stabilisation for the crazy zoom.... its a dog of a phone",15h
12,"So I upgraded from P30 Pro to Xperia 5 II which was a terrible phone, then to S20+. I regret the upgrade, the only good thing it's the camera, DEX and 3 years of upgrade, otherwise its a bad phone. I can barely hit 5h SOT with 96hz mode, CPU downclocked... when I'm using it on mobile data, it's starting to get hot, so please, for your information, don't buy a phone with the Exynos CPU..",12h
13,If your into camera. S20 is so much behind  with p30 with regards to software speed and  camera technology.,8h
14,"From a camera perspective it wouldn't actually be an upgrade (maybe even a downgrade). I would wait until you get a better offer.I'm just curious: For what do you have a ""free upgrade"". That sounds a little bit like a scam.",7h
15,"I loved my p30 phone it was awesome! The camera was amazing. When my time came to upgrade I knew I had to leave Huawei due to their breaches of security, and more. Didn't trust them enough anymore, and plus their play store is absolutely a pile of junk.So I went through the phones and I decided on the oppo find X2 pro, just before the x3 came out. But tbh not much difference and people still prefer the X2, over the x3.Everything on the oppo phone is amazing! You have a gaming section, the graphics and colour is amazing, you can customize your own ram on the phone at anytime buy giving up more or less storage space. Very very fast charging.I've had many many phones in my life and out of the ones I had I really love are:During childhood and teenage years:Nokia's - who didn'tSony Ericsson - again who didn'tDuring full time work onwards:Sony ExperiaHuawei - but not now after trust and their play store.OppoI did have:Samsung's - pile of poop with their camera and batteryBlackberry - regretted it as it was only popular for bbm, lacked everything like games, quality camera etc.Windows phone - lack of games, lack of camera quality, but still a good phone and layoutIphone - absolutely hate them! If the world only had iphones, then I would buy the very first mobile phone, that's how bad I hate them 😂.Again I recommend you try oppo I really happy with them and enjoying my phone.",6h
16,"NO! I did the same to S21 and the only better feature i have is the screen quallity and brightnes, video camera and two speakers and nothing else!!! For this price NO!Camera photos and zoom and night mode on P30 is much better than on S21. Video is not, is much better on S21 to be honest. Speed and software is way better on Emui 10.1 and 11 than Samsung OneUi 3.1 Android 11. Apps are to laggy in OneUi. Battery on S21 is bigger but on P30 is almost TWICE better battery life!!! Speed charging on P30 is much faster than on S21! Build quallity is much better on Huawei P30.Also both devices S20 and S21/+ and ultra are TOO HOT when you using phone in multitasking, apps and camera.Sometimes i'm scare to put my phone into pocket how is hot. On sunlight, dont use phone too much! ⚠️This is my experiance from Samsung S21 afther two month of using. Is beautifully GARBAGE phone! For this price you can buy much better phone.Before Samsung i was Huawei user almost 3 years, P10,20,30 and P40 (two weeks)In 2021 XXI century Samsung is overpriced brand like Apple, Sony...nothing else (Ultra is fantastic but the price is also much bigger)",59m

Download VMos Pro from here: https://www.vmos.com/VMOS works exactly like virtual box on windows, it's a virtual machine running Android with google services in it. I tried wetherspoons here and it works.For youtube app, use youtube vanced.For maps, google maps (you can't login and that's it).Install APK Pure for easy APK files. It is another app store. Aptoide is good too.When you can't install something in your phone itself (wetherspoons for example uses google services) you install it on vmos pro.You can't use GPay yet, and I don't know alternatives since I don't use NFC Pay.Idk if it's worth the effort for a mid-range p40 lite, but it's totally worth it for P40 Pro, since it's still 4th on Dxomark camera score worldwide even 1 year after release. If you can't live without GPay it's not that bad.",1d

4,Ya I have a mate 20 pro.  Been getting a ton of offers from my carrier to upgrade that i want to take but. I can't find a phone. Other than Huawei  that i like.   I have looked at the Sammy s21.   I really wish Huawei had licensed or bought bb10 os.   But I digress I keep looking at the p40pro. But i do  use Google apps alot. Ie drive maps. YouTube  play movies.Edit. Spelling and grammar,1d

11,"Enjoy! I loved mine, and probably the best phone ive ever used - but the google thing meant I moved onto a Find X3 pro in the end!",1d
12,I had the p40 pro for about 6 months or more from when it came out. But became a pain having to reload Google stuff and the banking apps along with off other apps wouldn't work. The Google apps had to be reloaded when the phone got a major update. So I put my p40 pro in exchange for a new p30 pro boxed a d sealed. This works great. Cex did me a good deal.,1d

0,P30pro is great. Had mine for 2 years! You won't regret it!,14d
1,"The GT2 Pro has 98% functionality with other Android manufacturers devices. Off the top of my head, you'd only be losing the remote shutter feature, as that requires EMUI. You can answer calls on other Android manufacturers devices, so I'm not sure where the statement that it's only Huawei devices came from.I think the P30 Pro is still a very solid device. I'm hoping it stays with me for another two years, but I really don't care about updates or features which I will only use once or twice, that you see on newer Android versions so I'm completely fine with sticking on Android 10. So it depends on how you feel about that too.5G situation is similar for me, no 5G yet but LTE is plenty fast for what I use mobile internet for. 5G is good for the infrastructure, but my personal use means it's not required yet.Given that the Mate 20 Pro and the P30 Pro are both using EMUI 11, if you want a change of scenery it wouldn't be the worst decision. Whether you would like to learn a different interface, or stick with what you know. You have the synergy with your laptop too, and whilst MSC has some uses, it's very convenient to transfer files wirelessly at the speed that Huawei Share offers",14d

0,"You can install almost all Gapps without GMS and they work. I used to have Google Keyboard, G Maps, G Translate, without GMS. The only problem it that you cannot login, so you cannot sync anything. But, you can downgrade your phone and sideload GMS, as I have now. The main problem with sideloaded GMS is that you miss notifications. I get only once a day Gmail notifications. No reddit notifications. Some Play Store notifications. I only have sideloaded GMS because I've bought some apps on Play Store, so I need to have it. If you have no paid apps, you can use just Petal Search. You can find almost everything there.

Discord app doesn't want to work if installed but you can open it in the browser or in dualspace, but I had issues of my calls suddenly going mute for no reason. Youtube also doesn't work for me unless I use dual space and browser I think. I don't trust the petal search alone because I prefer having apps be at one place since I feel like there is less chance of malware that way or compromised data banks. Most apps come from the Apkpure store, which someone has said got compromised before. Tho to this fact, maybe someone more tech savvy can say if I'm right or wrong to think that. The huawei Appgallery is also not really well stocked in the moment if you ask me.  I mostly stick to the apps I already use on my phone(mate 10) and just download those. I'm not gonna lie, I find it very inconvenient. I worry I'll need a new phone soon, had this one for 3+ years now and just today it started horribly overheating which it never did, and this whole situation does make me hesitant to get another Huawei device despite having great experiences with my current model.

The AppGalley has 98% of what I need & with Chinas position as the largest mobile phone consumers/users it pretty much a no brainier business decision.Currently Huawei is at that same point as Windows Mobile, their app store is what's going to determine whether HarmonyOS is successful or not. It isn't Huawei, it's the app developers (who also make a lot of their apps unnecessarily GMS dependant).Personally I find posts like this hilarious. What's happened isn't a secret.

If they sell phones and claim ""You can install Google Services, regarless of the ban"" it is a promise, and one they simply can't hold true forever because it is much easier for Google to prevent this from happening than for Huawei to make it happen. Huawei has decided to participate in a game which is dominated by one company on the software side. Relations like these always have huge risks and sometimes, as happened in that case, they will leave one party with a massive damage. And btw., just be cause I've read it a few times now, selling them Huawei phones dirt cheap in the western world is not an option, since they could be reimported to China easily and hurt Huawei even more. They still have a market of potentially 1.5 billion customers, although hurt, they'll survive.",24d
15,"OK lets address your points one by oneHuawei dont need to make any claims about installing Google. Like you quite correctly point out, it'd be at best a legal liability and more realistically brand damaing.What huawei can do is this. Make it easier for devs to create custom roms and apps to allow users to get around the ban.Google can circumvent Huawei and they have an interest in doing so - their pixel phone business only stands to gain if Huawei is out of the picture, so yes I agree with you there.Huawei had no choice but participate in a game dominated by one company, if any SE asian phone maker wants to break into western market, they pretty much have to embrace an open source ecosystem that has momentum in the west. Samsung tried otherwise with Tizen and failed....I am not sure how reimporting phones back into china will hurt Huawei - the overall volume of reimported phones is likely to be tiny and given the price difference between a Huawei phone in the US and China, Huawei would have to massively discount the phone to the point where they were taking a sizeable loss.Yes they do have a market of 1.5billion, but they also employ thousands of people in the west and that will cause misery for many.....Sometimes what seems obvious isnt....",24d

0,"Well apart from downgrading to emui 10.1.131 and installing the play store and update from there, yes gspace is a convenient way to use apps that absolutely require GMS. Nonetheless you can use a virtual machine that will get you into a shell of another phone in your phone such as VPhoneGaga or VMOS. Gspace is just easier on the eyes, but that's about it, although it does count in terms of practicality, as you don't have to enter a phone in your phone to operate some apps, as with gspace, you can create some bookmarks on your home page.And if you choose a third party launcher Nova, or any of your liking, you can use the swipe down from anywhere. If you are keen on emui there's a trick I have found which is that if you have day Nova installed, but emui launcher as the primary launcher, then you can select and add a nova action widget like pull down notification tray or quick settings. That way, you won't be able to slide, but you'll get a button easy enough to reach to pull it 8n the press of the finger. Added bonus to that, you can have more fluid animations and trigger small screen mode.",26d

1,"Basically, the way lithium ion battery technology works, it is best to only ever occasionally let the battery completely drain and be charged up to 100% as it puts more strain on the cells. It is recommended to not let a battery drop below 20% or charge above 80% the majority of the time to keep the battery in best health. However it is good to do a full drain and recharge every so often to affectively recalibrate all of the cells to avoid the first and last to charge/drain from becoming lost or unusable. It's a technology that is still constantly in development but these li-ion batteries are currently by far the most cost effective and practical for phones and laptops. Features like this are there to help preserve battery lifespan for those who charge overnight still, where in practice you should do 2 quick charges a day to see you through and make your device last as long as possible without needing a battery replacement",26d

I have all my relevant apps installed either from AppGallery or from Aurora Store.I was able to instal GMaps(they work), Google Chrome, I use Gboard as my main keyboard and GAuthenticator(all my tokens are saved on it). Those are the main GApps that I use.For the Mail app the native one does the job but you can use BlueMail available from the Aurora Store. Don't use any kind of assistant neither have I used before.The biggest downside is the notifications not being shown on apps dependent on GMS, however there is a fix for that it was posted on Huawei Community forum also on Huaweiblog.de I am happy with my choice and am not planing to switch to another brand just because it lacks GMS.Harmony OS looks promising, haven't received the update same as all international users, looking forward to it. The UI looks more polished hopefully we get battery optimisations and they unlock the bootloader.The display is crisp and vibrant which I love, the curves are not to everyones liking, even for myself switching from Mate 20 Pro it took me few days to adjust to the curvature. Stereo loudspeakers awesome cameras 66W charger which will come in handy if you are in a rush with low battery.Overall a great phone and a good looking phone, you'll definetely notice by yourself because in a world full of Sammies and iSheep the boldness of the design on this phone just is way above them",27d

0,Yeah the huawei ecosystem is definetly going strong. You can easily switch your buds from one device to another with just one click pretty much. You can use multi device cooperation.

0,I think some of the mate 10 series do. Not sure tho,29d
1,monochrome sensors stopped being used after the P20 generation as standard RGB (or in Huawei's case RYYG) sensors have improved to the point where a mono sensor doesnt add anything anymore,29d
2,"The Honor 8 also had a dedicated monochrome sensor, as does the mate 10 pro. Huawei decided to drop it in favor of the ultra wide angle lens, but to compensate, has a monochrome mode in its place that mimics black and white on a software tuning level. While you can get some really nice shots, compared to having an actual sensor the quality is not even close, a dedicated monochrome will best it always and whomever states otherwise is delusional at best.",29d
3,"Thanks ! That's why I'm asking ! I've tried to compare photos taken with B&W sensor on my XZ2 Premium and the same scene with Galaxy S10+ with conversion to B&W photo using different filters.

I really started to appreciate the possibility to take B&W photos when I tried it out with different sceneries where actually the light was most important part of the image.",29d

It works out an average based on algorithm, due to how both devices calculate steps.For instance, if you're pushing a baby in a pram, your watch may not count steps due to the arm swinging motion not occuring.

1,"Ooh, that was good news for me 😁 But will the health app then show too less steps if I have my phone only on a table most of the day? 😬",1m
2,The other commenter isn't actually correct. The phone counts it's own steps and merges them with the watches steps but removes any that have the same time log. The problem being that your phone will count steps when you're just using it as normal.We have asked time and time again for Huawei to let us just have the health app count from the watch and nothing else.,29d
3,Thank you for your help! I wanna ask (before i return the watch 😏) if there is any way to block the app from showing my phones step? And if there is any possibility to see how many calories i burned earlier days? The steps and calories are important for me to see also later 😬,24d

4,That might be true. But it would be weird to just end software updates of HarmonyOS that they switch to with their newer flagships and older flagships devices. Devices that come to HarmonyOS should at least receive updates for another 1-2 years. Newer flagships that get HarmonyOS earlier than the older ones should also get updates for 2 years minimum for some devices. It would be weird if they won't.,1m

3,Considering this is a laptop this advice is just... Insane.I'm not supposed to use it for something it was meant to do?Unless Huawei can magically deliver me 16+ hours battery life that sure as hell won't be possible on days where I'm using the device for work and then get home and want to watch a show or do some light coding with it.,1m

5,"I still can't believe that companies design their products in such a way that makes them unusable in advertised use-cases.No. It's not my job to look after a mobile PC by not treating it as one. If I just wanted something to use on my desk I have a desktop.I bought the MateBook as a companion on-the-go and while in bed, working on the balcony outside, etc. If it can't fulfill those use-cases the product is, by definition, flawed, and the manufacturer is to blame.It's really not the consumer's job to look after their laptops like collectible toys. They're tools to get a given job done and if they're poorly designed then Huawei doesn't deserve my money.Your mindset is incredibly anti-consumer, so I hope you see that now and if something you have doesn't serve you, and it's supposed to handle that given problem, you need to return it.The fact that this issue only occurs when the device is charging is a further indicator that this has to do with the battery and heat dissipation. My CPU is set to 70% of its allowed target clocks, so if the chassis cannot handle the 60W charger they should have added a toggle to disable fast-charging.",1m

1,"I understand, and I am happy to accept that the phone is ageing.But its harder to accept that, when the battery decay started immediately after updating to EMUI 11.My usage hasn't changed at all within the last 12 months.WiFi on, data off, Bluetooth on when necessary, nfc on, location on, no hot-spot, no cloud, no share.",1m
